#Planning Lewis's perfect profile

Hi Lewis, I've whipped together a few questions to help work out the style and aesthetic you want on your profile page. I took inspiration from [here](https://business.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-extract-the-facts-with-a-web-design-client-questionnaire--fsw-1830) 

1. What feeling or information do you want to have after visiting your website?
- i want to feel that the person who has viewed my website feels they have gained enough information about me and can close the website knowing enough about me and fulfilling the aim

2. What pages do you want on your webiste? How many?
-I think one page is best for a profile page - and thats all we have been asked to do - but i think that page should be mainly covering the facts and information about me - in a non vain way.

3. Describe your ideal aesthetic in a few sentences: this can be a mention of a fav celebrity, organisation, TV show. Why do you like them?
- i think my ideal aesthetic is very simple and just a plain, professional black, white and grey colour scheme, i like this because i feel it looks the most professional and in my opinion looks the best

4. List 3 websites you like,  why are they attractive to you?
A. Twitter, its got a simple layout that is very easy to use and everything is in sight etc
B. Coinbase.com, i like this websire as this is where i buy cryptocurrency, i feel it is attractive purely based on its functionality and its easy to use
C. I rarely use websites other than search engines and then the odd search but i prefer ones that are easy to use and laid out productively etc

5. List 3 websites you don't like, why are they hateful for you?
A. Reddit, i dont like reddit because it is very clustered and is a lot to take in which in turn means it isnt really appealing to me

6. Do you have a catchphrase? Think about what your friends or family might say. 
"that's bless"

That's all for now! Thanks for filling it in.
