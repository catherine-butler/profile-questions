#Planning Lewis's perfect profile

Hi Lewis, I've whipped together a few questions to help work out the style and aesthetic you want on your profile page. I took inspiration from [here](https://business.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-extract-the-facts-with-a-web-design-client-questionnaire--fsw-1830) 

1. What feeling or information do you want to have after visiting your website?

2. What pages do you want on your webiste? How many?

3. Describe your ideal aesthetic in a few sentences: this can be a mention of a fav celebrity, organisation, TV show. Why do you like them?

4. List 3 websites you like,  why are they attractive to you?

5. List 3 websites you don't like, why are they hateful for you?

6. Do you have a catchphrase? Think about what your friends or family might say. 

That's all for now! Thanks for filling it in.
