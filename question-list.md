Bio (where your from, stuff about you)
* Hi, my name is Lewis Murray, i am 20 years old and i am from Birmingham. I currently work in construction and have been for 2 years and prior to that i worked in a pub.

Dream: if you could you would... 
* I think that my ideal job if i could pick anything, other than working in tech that is, would either be a movie star or something to do with combat sports such as boxing as i enjoy both of them.

Personality traits (good and bad)
* I like to think that i can be quite funny sometimes
* I am sociable and friendly
* I can be quite annoying sometimes but that can be seen as a bad thing.

Hobbies & Interests (food, music)
* My faviourite food is probably steak or enchiladas
* My faviourite artists are probably Dave,Mhuncho or D-Block Europe as i listen to them the most
* I love watching Boxing and MMA and frequently watch it on the weekends
* I also enjoy going the gym, when they are open!
Desires and dreams
* Dream holiday - Santorini

3 things you wouldn't know about us
* Im a brown-black stripe in Kickboxing
* I know how to Ski

Frustrations

Describe your Perfect Day 
* I think an ideal day i have in mind is by being in a foreign country: either somewhere really hot or at a skiing resort, waking up then either hitting the slopes or grabbing a drink and relaxing in the sun, then a party on the night.
